# Si4712/13-B30 Datasheet Excerpts

> Production test conditions: VDD = 3.3 V, VIO = 3.3 V, TA = 25 °C, FRF = 98 MHz. Characterization test conditions: VDD = 2.7 to 5.5 V, VIO = 1.5 to 3.6 V, TA = –20 to 85 °C, FRF = 76–108 MHz. Transmit Frequency Range fRF 76 — 108 MHz.

> The Si4712/13-B30 integrates the complete transmit functions for standards-compliant unlicensed FM broadcast stereo transmission. The chip also allows integrated receive power scanning to identify low signal power FM channels. Users must comply with local regulations on radio frequency (RF) transmission.
